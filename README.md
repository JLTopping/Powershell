Beginner Powershell Scripts

These were all made within the past year as I've started learning powershell from scratch, so I'm sure there are much simpler ways to do some of these now. If you have any ideas on how to optimize these, I would love to hear them.

All these scripts worked for me in the situation I needed them in, but they could very well have bugs now. If you are experiencing issues with any of these scripts, please let me know the issue and I'll look into correcting it.

Lastly, due to these just being in my personal collection during this past year, some elements or functions of these scripts are just been minorly modified versions of existing scripts from other users who have not been credited by name. If you notice something that you or someone you know wrote or created, please share your name and a link to your script and I'll gladly give credit.

Thank you all for the support over this past year of learning powershell, and I hope this can help some of you as well!
