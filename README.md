Beginner Powershell Scripts

All these scripts worked for me in the situation I needed them in, but they could very well have issues now. If you are experiencing issues
 with any of these scripts, please let me know the issue and I'll get it corrected.

These were all made within the past year as I've started learning powershell from scratch, so I'm sure there are much simpler ways to do some of these now. If you have any ideas on how to optimize these, I would love to hear them.

Thank you all for the support over this past year of learning powershell, and I hope this can help some of you as well!
